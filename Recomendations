Repository Focus: Decide if the repository is for documentation (e.g., Unichain guides, weETH tracking), development (e.g., token deployment), or both. This shapes content.

Community Engagement: Share the repository on Unichain’s Discord (#unichain channel) or X to attract contributors. Follow @Unichain
 for updates.

Further Steps:
Run a Unichain node using Uniswap/unichain-node to test deployments.

Use CoinFactory for easy ERC-20 deployment on Unichain Sepolia.

Monitor Ether.fi’s announcements for weETH on Unichain.
