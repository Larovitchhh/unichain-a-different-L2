# Unichain L2 Exploration

This repository is dedicated to [Unichain](https://www.unichain.org), an Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain built by Uniswap Labs for decentralized finance (DeFi). Unichain leverages the Optimism Superchain for fast, low-cost transactions and cross-chain liquidity. Mainnet launched on February 11, 2025, with features like 1-second block times and a TEE-based block builder.[](https://www.unichain.org/explore)[](https://dailyhodl.com/2025/02/11/uniswap-labs-launches-mainnet-for-new-ethereum-layer-2-unichain/)

## Purpose
- Explore Unichain’s DeFi capabilities, including token deployment (e.g., weETH).
- Provide resources for developers to build on Unichain’s testnet/mainnet.
- Document SuperStacks campaign integration, if applicable.

## Key Features of Unichain
- **Speed**: 1-second block times, with 250ms sub-blocks planned.[](https://blog.uniswap.org/introducing-unichain)
- **Cost**: 95% lower fees than Ethereum L1.[](https://www.antiersolutions.com/blogs/unichain-blockchain-key-features-functionality-and-use-cases-explained/)
- **Interoperability**: Part of the Optimism Superchain for cross-chain DeFi.[](https://cryptoast.fr/unichain-layer-2-uniswap/)
- **Security**: TEE-based block building and decentralized validation network (UVN).[](https://www.panewslab.com/en/articledetails/x2kjw3u7.html)

## weETH on Unichain
- **weETH** (Wrapped eETH) is a liquid staking token by Ether.fi. No official contract address for weETH on Unichain was found, but this repository can track its potential deployment.
- Example: Use [zunxbt/unichain](https://github.com/zunxbt/unichain) for ERC-20 token deployment on Unichain Sepolia testnet.[](https://github.com/zunxbt/unichain)
